# Brandeis Dining Hall Food Review App

This app can be used by any business owner/worker who is looking to get some feedback on their service. This app utilizes MongoDB Atlas, a cloud application database platform, to collect data. I focused on Brandeis Dining Hall for this project but with a few changes to the code, anyone can use this app to get customer feedback!



#### Design of the app
